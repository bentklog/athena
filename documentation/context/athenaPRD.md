# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Athena: AI Knowledge Management Assistant

### 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** Athena

**Product Vision:** Athena is an AI knowledge management assistant that enhances the note-taking experience by organizing, cleaning, connecting, and enriching content in Obsidian markdown files. It acts as a personal librarian and gardener for your digital knowledge, helping you maintain focus, discover connections, and resurface valuable insights.

**Product Type:** AI-powered knowledge management tool

### 2. Problem Statement

Knowledge workers and enthusiastic note-takers face several challenges:
- Notes become disorganized and difficult to parse over time
- Valuable connections between ideas are missed
- Past interests and insights get buried and forgotten
- Finding relevant external content requires additional effort
- Maintaining consistent formatting and organization is time-consuming

Athena solves these problems by providing an intelligent assistant that cleans, organizes, connects, and enriches notes automatically, saving time while enhancing the value of the user's knowledge base.

### 3. Target Users

**Primary Persona: The Knowledge Worker**

- Values organization but struggles to maintain it consistently
- Desires connections between ideas but lacks time to create them manually
- Wants to stay focused on key topics while discovering relevant content

### 4. User Stories

1. As a messy note-taker, I want my notes to be automatically cleaned and formatted so they're crisp and easily parseable when I review them.

2. As someone who gets distracted, I want AI to help me stay focused on topics I'm interested in and recommend relevant articles and resources.

3. As someone who likes to revisit past interests, I want AI to resurface old notes and topics to help my brain make interesting connections.

4. As a knowledge worker, I want to see connections between my notes that I might have missed.

5. As an Obsidian user, I want control over which notes and folders the AI can access to maintain privacy.

6. As a busy professional, I want to receive regular insights and suggestions without being overwhelmed.
